                MPLS Network Action for Stack Management
              draft-ihle-mpls-mna-stack-management-latest

Abstract

   The MPLS Network Action (MNA) framework provides a general mechanism
   for the encoding and processing of network actions and their data.

   This document introduces a network action to the MPLS Network Action
   (MNA) framework for stack management operations including MOVE-N-LSE
   and POP-N-LSE.  The MOVE-N-LSE operation elevates a specified number
   of LSEs within the stack facilitating a more efficient structure of
   the MPLS stack.  The POP-N-LSE operation removes a specified number
   of LSEs facilitating mechanisms such as Stateless MNA-based Egress
   Protection (SMEP).

1.  Introduction

   The MPLS Network Action (MNA) framework encodes network actions and
   their parameters in the MPLS stack.  [I-D.ietf-mpls-mna-hdr] defines
   the encoding of such network actions and their data in LSEs.  These
   network actions are processed by all nodes on a path (hop-by-hop), by
   only selected nodes, or on an ingress-to-egress basis.

   This document introduces a network action for stack management
   operations.  Those operations include a MOVE-N-LSE and a POP-N-LSE
   operation.  With the MOVE-N-LSE operation, a number of N LSEs from
   below the NAS is brought to the top-of-stack.  This can be leveraged
   to enable more efficient MPLS processing with MNA.  An example for
   this is given in this document using a mechanism called HBH
   preservation.  With the POP-N-LSE operation, a number of N LSEs below
   the NAS is popped.  This can be used to facilitate mechanisms such as
   Stateless MNA-based Egress Protection (SMEP).  SMEP provides an
   alternative to the rerouting mechanism defined for the PLR in
   [RFC8679] allowing the PLR to be stateless by carrying Bypass MPLS
   Labels (BML) in the stack.

   However, the stack management operations are not tied to specific use
   cases and may also be applied for various other use cases.

3.  Stack Management Operations

   This section describes the stack management network action encoding
   and the processing in an LSR.

3.1.  Network Action Encoding

   The network action for stack management operations is encoded as
   follows:

   *  Network action indication: The stack management network action is
      indicated by opcode TBA1.

   *  Format: The stack management network action MUST be encoded using
      a Format B or a Format C LSE as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-mpls-mna-hdr], see Figure 1 and Figure 2.

   *  Scope: The stack management network action can be used in any
      scope, i.e., in the select, HBH, and I2E scope.  The scope depends
      on the use case.

   *  Ancillary data: The stack management network action requires four
      bits of in-stack ancillary data per operation (pop and move) to
      encode the number of labels, i.e., the numbers MOVE-N and POP-N.

      -  In Format B, the four least-significant bits of the ancillary
         data field contain the value of MOVE-N.  The next four bits
         contain the value of POP-N.  All other ancillary data bits MUST
         be set to zero and are reserved for future use.

      -  In Format C, the same encoding of POP-N-LSEs and MOVE-N-LSEs
         applies to the first data field of the LSE.  The second data
         field, i.e., the 4-bit wide ancillary data field, MUST be set
         to zero and is reserved for future use.

   *  Post-stack data: None.

   Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrate the stack management operation
   encoding in Format B and C.

3.2.  Processing

   A node that processes the stack management network action MUST
   perform the MOVE-N-LSE and POP-N-LSE operation according to the
   corresponding parameter N > 0.  If N = 0, the corresponding operation
   is not applied.

   *  For MOVE-N > 0, MOVE-N LSEs below the NAS are brought to the top-
      of-stack.

   *  For POP-N > 0, POP-N LSEs below the NAS are popped.

   The ingress LER MUST ensure that no invalid state, e.g., a MOVE-N-LSE
   operation with MOVE-N > #LSEs below the NAS, results from the
   processing of the stack management network action.

   If multiple NAS with the stack management network action are present
   in the stack and are processed by a single node, all values for
   MOVE-N or POP-N are summed up respectively.  The operation, i.e., pop
   or move, is then applied based on the summed up value.

4.  Use Cases and Examples

   This section explains one use case for each operation and illustrates
   it in an example.

4.1.  MOVE-N-LSE

   First, we describe the concept of HBH preservation.  Then, we explain
   how the MOVE-N-LSE operation is used for this concept, and give an
   example.

4.1.1.  HBH Preservation

   In the MNA framework, each node must be able to access the HBH-scoped
   Network Action Substack (NAS).  The HBH-scoped NAS must be within the
   readable label depth (RLD) of each node.  To achieve this, redundant
   copies of the NAS are placed at different positions in the MPLS stack
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-mna-hdr].  This increases the overall stack size.
   Further, routers must scan through unrelated stack entries to find
   the HBH-scoped NAS.  This adds parsing overhead and is difficult on
   hardware with limited RLD.

   The HBH preservation mechanism keeps the HBH-scoped NAS within reach
   of all nodes by placing the NAS always below the top-of-stack label.
   When a node pops the top label, it moves the next forwarding label
   below the NAS to the top.  This prevents the NAS from being exposed
   and removed.  Nodes can process it without scanning through unrelated
   labels.  This avoids redundant copies and reduces RLD pressure
   [IhMe25-2].

4.1.2.  MOVE-N-LSE Operation for HBH Preservation

   The stack management network action with the MOVE-N-LSE operation is
   added to the HBH-scoped NAS with MOVE-N = 1 to apply the HBH
   preservation mechanism.  Each node popping the top-of-stack label and
   processing this action brings one LSE from below the NAS to the top.
   This prevents the HBH-scoped NAS from being exposed to the top.

   However, this mechanism poses a challenge when there are MNA-
   incapable nodes on the path.  An MNA-incapable node pops the top-of-
   stack forwarding label and exposes the HBH-scoped NAS to the top,
   leading to packet drop at the next hop.  To fix this, the MOVE-N-LSE
   operation can be leveraged to bring LSEs at the preceding node of an
   MNA-incapable node to the top using a select-scoped NAS.  This way,
   forwarding labels for upcoming MNA-incapable nodes are brought to the
   top and the HBH-scoped NAS is never exposed.  The MNA-capabilities
   are signaled to the ingress LER.  Therefore, the ingress LER places a
   select-scoped network action for the preceding node of MNA-incapable
   nodes in the MPLS stack.  No information about MNA capabilities of
   neighboring nodes is required in a transit node as all node
   capabilities are signaled to the ingress LER.

4.1.3.  Example

   An example is illustrated in Figure 3.

    MNA         ¬MNA         ¬MNA          MNA
    LSR ───L1─── LSR ───L2─── LSR ───L3─── LSR
    R1          R2            R3           R4
    (1)         (2)           (3)          (4)


   MPLS label stacks:
   (1)
   MPLS Label L1     -> pop + forward
   HBH-scoped NAS:    MOVE-N-LSE=1  -> process
   Select-scoped NAS: MOVE-N-LSE=2  -> process + pop
   MPLS Label L2     -> move to top
   MPLS Label L3     -> move to top
   MPLS Label L4     -> move to top
   MPLS Label L5

   (2)
   MPLS Label L2     -> pop + forward
   MPLS Label L3
   MPLS Label L4
   HBH-scoped NAS
   MPLS Label L5

   (3)
   MPLS Label L3     -> pop + forward
   MPLS Label L4
   HBH-scoped NAS
   MPLS Label L5

   (4)
   MPLS Label L4     -> pop + forward
   HBH-scoped NAS:   MOVE-N-LSE=1  -> process
   MPLS Label L5     -> move to top

             Figure 3: Example using the MOVE-N-LSE operation.

   In Figure 3, a MNA-capable node is followed by two MNA-incapable
   nodes.  Therefore, the stack management network action with MOVE-N =
   2 for the MOVE-N-LSE operation is pushed by the ingress LER as a
   select-scoped NAS for the LSR R1.  Further, to enable the HBH
   preservation mechanism, the stack management action with MOVE-N = 1
   for the MOVE-N-LSEs operation is added to the HBH-scoped NAS.  R1
   brings three LSEs to the top-of-stack, two from the MOVE-N-LSE
   operation in the select-scoped NAS and one from the HBH-scoped NAS.
   At the MNA-incapable LSRs R2 and R3, the forwarding label is popped
   without exposing the NAS to the top.  Finally, the MNA-capable LSR R4
   processes the HBH-scoped NAS and brings one LSE from below the NAS to
   the top.

4.2.  POP-N-LSE

   First, we describe the concept of Stateless MNA-based Egress
   Protection (SMEP).  Then, we explain how the POP-N-LSE operation is
   used for this concept, and give an example.

4.2.1.  Stateless MNA-based Egress Protection (SMEP)

   The egress protection framework defined in [RFC8679] is
   comprehensive.  It provides a mechanism for rerouting traffic in the
   event of an egress failure, and explains how rerouted services and
   their associated context can be restored.  Stateless MNA-based Egress
   Protection (SMEP) provides an alternative to the rerouting mechanism
   defined for the PLR, allowing the PLR to be stateless
   [I-D.ihle-mpls-mna-stateless-egress-protection-00].  Thus, the PLR
   does not need to maintain a table that maps transport tunnels to
   backup paths.  Likewise, the PLR is not involved in the signaling of
   such information.  Instead, this information is supplied from the
   ingress to the PLR in the network action.  Signaling is only needed
   between ingress, egress, and the protector, but not with the PLR
   anymore.

   However, in the proposed SMEP network action encoding in
   [I-D.ihle-mpls-mna-stateless-egress-protection-00], the 20 bit BMLs
   are split across the AD fields of a network action.  This requires
   the PLR to extract the BML from the network action.

4.2.2.  POP-N-LSE Operation for SMEP

   The POP-N-LSE operation simplifies the application of SMEP.  The BMLs
   are contained as forwarding LSEs in the MPLS stack without the need
   to encode the bypass tunnel information in the AD fields of a network
   action.  The processing at the PLR is as follows:

   1.  If the PLR does not detect an egress failure

       *  The PLR executes the POP-N-LSE action and pops all BMLs.

       *  The packet is forwarded as usual to the egress node.

   2.  If the PLR detects an egress failure

       *  The POP-N-LSE action is ignored and is popped along with the
          top-of-stack label.

       *  The BML is now the top-of-stack label.  The packet is
          forwarded to the protector based on the BML.

4.2.3.  Example

   An example of the POP-N-LSE Operation for SMEP is given in Figure 4.

         Figure 4: Example using the POP-N-LSE operation for SMEP.

   The example network contains an LSP R1-R2-R3 and a bypass tunnel R2-
   R3'-R3''.  The label stack contains the forwarding labels L1, L2, L3,
   L3', and L3''.  If there is no egress failure, the LSR R2 executes
   the POP-N-LSE action with POP-N = 2 and pops the BMLs L3' and L3''.
   The packet is forwarded as usual according to the top-of-stack label
   L3.  If the LSR R2 detects an egress failure it becomes the PLR.  The
   POP-N-LSE action is ignored and the NAS is popped along with the top-
   of-stack label.  This time, the BMLs L3' and L3'' are at the top-of-
   stack.  The packet is forwarded according to those labels to the
   alternative egress node R3''.
